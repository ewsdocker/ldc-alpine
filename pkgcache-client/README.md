### ewsdocker/alpine-pkgcache-client:3.10.0

**ewsdocker/alpine-pkgcache-client** is a simple **Alpine Linux**-based **Docker** image designed as a console interface to maintain the data and configuration files used by **ewsdocker/alpine-nginx-pkgcache**. 

**ewsdocker/alpine-nginx-pkgcache** is a **NGINX HHTP** Web server image based on [ewsdocker/alpine-nginx](https://github.com/ewsdocker/alpine-nginx).  

**alpine-nginx-pkgcache** provides a method, using only existing Docker containers and Docker resources, to add files to a permanent file-cache and retrieve selected files from the file-cache by a running **Docker build** process.

#### Running the installed scripts  

After running the above command script, and using the settings indicated, the docker host directories, mapped as shown in the above tables, will be configured as follows:

 - the executable scripts have been copied to **~/bin**;  
 - the application desktop file(s) have been copied to **~/.local/share/applications**, and are availablie in any _task bar_ menu;  
 - the associated **alpine-pkgcache-client-"version"** executable script (shown below) will be found in **~/.local/bin**, and _should_ be customized with proper local volume names.

    docker run -it \
               --rm \
               --network=pkgnet \
               -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
               -v ${HOME}/source:/source \
               -v ${HOME}/workspace-alpine-pkgcache-client-latest:/workspace \
               --mount source=pkgcache,target=/pkgcache \
               --name=alpine-pkgcache-client-latest \
           ewsdocker/alpine-pkgcache-client:latest  

To create and run the container, enter the following command on the console command-line:

    ~/.local/bin/alpine-pkgcache-client-latest  

____  
**ewsdocker/alpine-pkgcache-client:3.10.0**
  
    docker run -it \
               --rm \
               --network=pkgnet \
               -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
               -v ${HOME}/source:/source \
               -v ${HOME}/workspace-alpine-pkgcache-client-3.10.0:/workspace \
               --mount source=pkgcache,target=/pkgcache \
               --name=alpine-pkgcache-client-3.10.0 \
           ewsdocker/alpine-pkgcache-client:3.10.0
