### ewsdocker/alpine-nginx-pkgcache:3.10.0  
A **NGINX HHTP** Web server image based on [ewsdocker/alpine-nginx](https://github.com/ewsdocker/alpine-nginx).  

**alpine-nginx-pkgcache** provides a method, using only existing Docker containers and Docker resources, to add files to a permanent file-cache and retrieve selected files from the file-cache by a running **Docker build** process.  

Learn about the [pkgcache](https://github.com/ewsdocker/ewsdocker.github.io/wiki/pkgcache") project on the [Advanced Docker Concepts - pkgcache](https://github.com/ewsdocker/ewsdocker.github.io/wiki/pkgcache) Wiki page.

**Installing ewsdocker/alpine-nginx-pkgcache**  

The following script will download the selected **ewsdocker/alpine-nginx-pkgcache** image, create a container, setup and populate the directory structures, and create the execution script(s).  

The _default_ values will install all directories and contents in the **docker host** user's home directory.  

**ewsdocker/alpine-nginx-pkgcache:3.10.0**
  
    docker run --rm \
               -v ${HOME}/bin:/userbin \
               -v ${HOME}/.local:/usrlocal \
               -e LMS_BASE="${HOME}/.local" \
               -v ${HOME}/.config/docker:/conf \
               -v ${HOME}/.config/docker/alpine-nginx-pkgcache-3.10.0:/root \
               --name=alpine-nginx-pkgcache-3.10.0 \
           ewsdocker/alpine-nginx-pkgcache:3.10.0 lms-setup-alpine  

____  

**Running the installed scripts**

After running the above command script, and using the settings indicated, the docker host directories, mapped as shown in the above tables, will be configured as follows:

 - the executable scripts have been copied to **~/bin**;  
 - the associated **alpine-nginx-pkgcache-"version"** execution script (shown below) will be found in **~/.local/bin**, and _should_ be customized with proper local volume names.  

The installation documentation for [ewsdocker/alpine-nginx]() shows 2 different examples to install the server.  The connection of **ewsdocker/alpine-nginx-pkgcache** to the server depends upon the method of installation, as detailed in the 2 following sections.  

____  

The following _docker run_ command will create and start _alpine-nginx-pkgcache_ service container :

    docker run -d \
           --restart unless-stopped \
           --mount source=pkgcache,target=/usr/share/nginx/html \
           --network=pkgnet \
           --name=alpine-nginx-pkgcache \
