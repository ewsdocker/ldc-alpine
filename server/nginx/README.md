 The <i>ldc-alpine:anginx</i> docker image is based on the latest 
 <i>NGINX</i> mainline version in an  <i>Alpine Linux Docker</i> image.  

 <ul>
  <li>A pre-built <i>ldc-alpine:anginx Docker</i> image is available on 
   <a href="https://hub.docker.com">Docker Hub</a> at 
   <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/ewsdocker/alpine-nginx/">
      ewsdocker/alpine-nginx
   </a>;
  </li>
  <li>The source for 
   <i>ewsdocker/alpine-nginx</i> is available on 
   <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> at 
   <a href="https://github.com/ewsdocker/alpine-nginx">

<p>
 The <i>ewsdocker/ldc-alpine:nginx</i> docker image is <b>NOT</b> an
 official release of <i>Nginx</i>.  
 <ul> 
  <li>
   The official release of Nginx is available on 
   <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> 
   from 
   <a href="https://github.com/nginxinc">Nginx, Inc.</a>;  
  </li>
  <li>
   The official build of <i>Nginx</i> is available on

<b>Installing ewsdocker/ldc-alpine:nginx</b>

<p>
 Below are presented two examples of the many ways to download, create and start 
 the service container.  Both examples have strengths and weaknesses.  
 <dl>
  <dt>Docker Volume</dt>
   <dd>  
    This is the easiest procedure to understand.  It uses the _volume_ option 
    to map the <i>Nginx</i> html folder in the <i>ldc-alpine:nginx</i> container 
    to a <i>Docker host</i> folder (in the calling user's home folder) 
    to be used for the <i>NGINX</i> html folder.  
   </dd>
  <br />
  <dt>Docker Mount</dt>  
   <dd>
    This procedure uses the <i>mount</i> option of the <i>docker run</i> command 
    to map a <b>Docker Volume</b> on the <b>Docker Host</b> to the 
    <b>alpine-nginx</b> <i>Nginx</i> html folder.  
    It requires creation of a <b>Docker Volume</b>, which adds to the complexity.
    However, the benefit is that it is a <b>Docker</b> volume and 
    not a <i>user's</i> folder;
   </dd>
 </dl>
</p>

<p>
 In both approaches, the image will be 
 <ul>
  <li>pulled from Docker Hub (if it is not already present),</li>
  <li>built into a web service container (if it is not already created), and </li>
  <li>started on <b>port 80</b>.</li>  
 </ul>
</p>

<hr />

<dl>
 <dt><b>Docker Volume.</b></dt>
  <dd>
   <p>
   In this example, the <i>~/.local/shared/nginx-html</i> folder 
   (in the calling user's home directory) will contain the html 
   documents to serve.  HTML data (Web Pages) to be served 
   should be added to the <i>nginx-html</i> folder.  
   </p>
   <p>
   Execute the following <i>docker run</i> command to download the image, 
   create a service container and start the service on port 80:
   </p>

    docker run -d \
               --restart unless-stopped \
               -v ${HOME}/.local/shared/nginx-html:/usr/share/nginx/html \
               -p 80:80 \
               --name=alpine-nginx-3.10.0 \
           ewsdocker/ldc-alpine:nginx-0.1.0-b4  

  </dd>

 <hr />  

 <dt><b>Docker Mount.</b></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
  This procedure uses the <i>mount</i> option to mount a 
  <b>Docker</b> volume to be used for the <i>Nginx</i> html folder.  
  <ul>
   <li>Check for existence of the <b>nginx-html</b> volume:</li>  
    
    docker volume inspect nginx-html
    
   <li>If the response is <b>Error: No such volume: nginx-html</b>, 
       create the volume:</li>

    docker volume create nginx-html  

   </ul>
   
   HTML data (Web Pages) to be served should be added to the <i>nginx-html</i>
   volume, starting in the /, or root, directory.  
  </p>

  <p>
   Execute the following <i>docker run</i> command to download the image, create a 
   service container and start the service on port 80:
  </p>

    docker run -d \
               --restart unless-stopped \
               --mount source=nginx-html,target=/usr/share/nginx/html \
               -p 80:80 \
               --name=alpine-nginx-3.10.0 \
           ewsdocker/ldc-alpine:nginx-0.1.0-b4  

  </dd>
</dl>
